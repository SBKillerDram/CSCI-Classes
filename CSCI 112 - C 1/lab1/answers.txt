1. My shell prompt looks like a black box with the normal border around it.

2. It just brought up the same line that i typed ls into because there are no
     directories in it.

3. In the command line type mkdir cs201.

4. By using the commands ls and cd you navigate your way thru your folders till       you get to the desirded folder and in this case it is cs201.

5. The three ways are by typing one of these commands "cd /"(goes start to
     home), "cd .." (takes you back one), "cd <pathname>".

6. I do not know.
