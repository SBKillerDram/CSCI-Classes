1)  '(4 2 5 2 6 10)
2) This function increases each number in the list by one
3) It checks to see it the list is null
4) It creates an empty set
5) It adds 1 to the first item in the list then calls f with the second second item in the list
6) cons (+ 1 3) (f ( 1 4 1 5 9))
   cons (+ 1 1) (f ( 4 1 5 9))
   cons (+ 1 4) (f (1 5 9))
   cons (+ 1 1) (f (5 9))
   cons (+ 1 5) (f (9))
   cons (+ 1 9) (f ())
   '()
7) #f
8) member? uses head recursion
9) #f
10) Tail recursion can be beneficail to use when trying to optimize the compiler effeincy because the language will
	regonize when you are doing it and will reuse the current frame instead of adding a new one on the stack each
	time the call is made.
11) '(green eggs and ham)
12) '(and macaroni)
13) I like easy to understand and use Dr. racket was to use and understand. It made learning scheme alot easier.
