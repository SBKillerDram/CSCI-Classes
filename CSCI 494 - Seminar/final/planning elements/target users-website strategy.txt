Target Users:
	People that are trying to learn basic mathmatical operations.

Website Stategy:
	We split the project into two parts: homepage and math sections.
	For the homepage we have the create account and login sections. Here we were unable to create a way to store
	the username and password to make it presistent.
	For the math section we have it to randomly pick questions and randomly generate numbers. The user then fills
	in their answer and hits submit to check their answer and they are told which ones are correct or not and they
	are able to retry the incorrect ones again. The next next gets thm a new set of questions.
